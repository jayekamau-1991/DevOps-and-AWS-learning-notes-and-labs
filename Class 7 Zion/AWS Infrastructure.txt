Notes for EC2
Amazon EC2 「
• EC2 is one of the most popular of AWS' offering
• EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
• It mainly consists in the capability of :
• Renting virtual machines (EC2)
• Storing data on virtual drives (EBS)
• Distributing load across machines (ELB)
• Scaling the services using an auto-scaling group (ASG)
• Knowing EC2 is fundamental to understand how the Cloud works

 EC2 sizing & configuration options
• Operating System (OS): Linux, Windows or Mac OS
• How much compute power & cores (CPU)
• How much random-access memory (RAM)
• How much storage space:
• Network-attached (EBS & EFS)
• hardware (EC2 Instance Store)
• Network card: speed of the card, Public IP address
• Firewall rules: security group
• Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data

EC2 User Data
• It is possible to bootstrap our instances using an EC2 User data script.
• bootstrapping means launching commands when a machine starts
• That script is only run once at the instance first start
• EC2 user data is used to automate boot tasks such as:
• Installing updates
• Installing software
• Downloading common files from the internet
• Anything you can think of
• The EC2 User Data Script runs with the root user

lebsite Hands On
Hands-On:
Launching an EC2 Instance running Linux
• We'll be launching our first virtual server using the AWS Console
• We'll get a first high-level approach to the various parameters
• We'll see that our web server is launched using EC2 user data
• We'll learn how to start / stop / terminate our instance.

EC2 Instance Types ----
EC2 Instance Types - Overview
• You can use different types of EC2 instances that are optimised for
different use cases (https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/)

• AWS has the following naming convention:
m5.2xlarge

m: instance class
5: generation (AWS improves them over time)
2xlarge: size within the instance class

EC2 Instance Types - General Purpose
• Great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories
• Balance between:
• Compute
• Memory
• Networking
• In the course, we will be using the t2.micro which is a General Purpose EC2
instance
General Purpose
General purpose instances provide a balance of compute, memory and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of diverse
workloads. These instances are ideal for applications that use these resources in equal proportions such as web servers and code
repositories.

EC2 Instance Types - Compute Optimized
• Great for compute-intensive tasks that require high performance
processors:
• Batch processing workloads
• Media transcoding
• High performance web servers
• High performance computing (HPC)
• Scientific modeling & machine learning
• Dedicated gaming servers
Compute Optimized
Compute Optimized instances are ideal for compute bound applications that benefit from high performance processors. Instances
belonging to this family are well suited for batch processing workloads, media transcoding, high performance web servers, high
performance computing (HPC), scientific modeling, dedicated gaming servers and ad server engines, machine learning inference and
other compute intensive applications.

EC2 Instance Types - Memory Optimized
• Fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory
• Use cases:
• High performance, relational/non-relational databases
• Distributed web scale cache stores
• In-memory databases optimized for BI (business intelligence)
• Applications performing real-time processing of big unstructured data
Memory Optimized
Memory optimized instances are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory.

EC2 Instance Types - Storage Optimized
• Great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write
access to large data sets on local storage
• Use cases:
• High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems
• Relational & NoSQL databases
• Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis)
• Data warehousing applications
• Distributed file systems
Storage Optimized
Storage optimized instances are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on
local storage. They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random 1/0 operations per second (IOPS) to applications.
